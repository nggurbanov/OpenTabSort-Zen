// OpenTabSort Zen — Ollama prompt builders.
//
// Pure string-building functions for the five prompts we send to Ollama:
//   - classifyExisting  → "fit each tab into one of the existing categories"
//   - cluster           → "these tabs don't fit existing categories, invent new ones"
//   - unified           → single-call combination of the above two
//   - fresh             → Arc-Tidy: ignore existing categories, re-cluster everything
//   - merge             → "consolidate these over-specialized categories"
//
// No side effects, no I/O, no `await`. Pulled out of ollama.mjs to keep the
// orchestrator file focused on flow rather than prose.

Categories:
${renderCategoryList(rules)}

Tabs:
${renderTabList(unmatched)}

Output ONLY a JSON object mapping each tab number (as a string key) to the chosen category name. Use "none" ONLY for tabs that are genuinely unrelated to every category — most tabs should match a category.`;

// ─── Cluster (older fallback: invent new groups for unmatched) ───────────────

export const buildClusterPrompt = (leftover) =>
  `These browser tabs don't fit any existing category. Group them into one or more NEW categories.

Guidelines:
- Use short, clear category names in Title Case (1-3 words)
- Group tabs together when they share a clear topic, type of site, or purpose
- A single tab can be its own category if it's clearly its own topic
- Put tabs that have no meaningful category in "skipped"

Tabs:
${renderTabList(leftover)}

Output ONLY a JSON object with this exact shape:
{
  "groups": [
    {"name": "Gaming", "tabs": [0, 3]},
    {"name": "Recipes", "tabs": [1]}
  ],
  "skipped": [2, 4]
}`;

// ─── Unified (Phase 4b: single-call classify + invent) ───────────────────────
//
// Prompt design notes for small local models:
//   - Avoid imperative phrases the model might literally echo back (it has
//     returned "New Category: Gaming", "Recipes", "Skipped" verbatim before).
//   - Prefer descriptive phrasing over directive labels.
//   - State the "prefer broad clusters" constraint as a concrete observation
//     (3 gaming tabs → 1 category) rather than abstract instruction.
//   - Never include the literal word "category" in surrounding example text.

export const buildUnifiedPrompt = (rules, unmatched, snippets) =>
  `Sort the tabs below into a small number of buckets. Look at all of them together before deciding.

For each tab, pick a single label that is one of:
- One of the existing labels listed (matched exactly)
- A short new label of your choosing (1-3 words, plain Title Case)
- "skipped" if the tab really doesn't fit with anything

Guidance:
- Use an existing label only when the tab is the SAME KIND of thing as that label's example domains — same service, same provider, or a near-equivalent substitute. The example domains define what the label means. Do NOT use an existing label as a generic catch-all because its name sounds related. If no existing label closely fits, create a new label or "skipped".
- Several tabs about the same topic should share the SAME label. For example, three different gaming sites (news, marketplace, ranking) all belong under ONE shared label.
- Aim for 4-10 stable intent buckets across a normal workspace. For this batch, add at most 1-2 new labels when possible. Broad but coherent buckets beat narrow one-tab labels.
- Keep adjacent intent families separate unless the tabs clearly share the same exact task: Docs (files, documents, writing) vs Research (articles, papers, reference reading) vs Work (trackers, admin, ops, business tools).
- Keep Shopping (products, carts, stores) separate from Finance (banking, payments, taxes, invoices) and Planning (calendar, maps, bookings, trips, events).
- Keep Communication (email, chat, messages, meetings) separate from Media (video, music, podcasts, streaming). Watching or listening is not the same as messaging.
- Keep Internal/Tools (browser settings, extensions, dashboards, dev/admin utilities) separate from user-facing content.
- A new label that covers only one tab is unusual — only pick one if that tab is clearly its own distinct topic with no siblings here.
- Do not echo the tab's title or hostname as the label.
- Do not include any of these words in the label: "new", "category", "label", "topic", "skipped".

Existing labels (with example domains):
${renderCategoryList(rules)}

${renderTabList(unmatched, snippets)}

Output raw JSON only: a JSON object mapping EVERY tab number shown above (string key) to exactly one chosen label. Do not omit any tab.`;

// ─── Fresh (Phase 4c: Arc-Tidy — ignore existing, re-cluster all) ────────────

export const buildFreshPrompt = (tabs, snippets) =>
  `Look at all these browser tabs and cluster them into a small number of new categories that you invent. Ignore any current grouping — start fresh.

Tabs:
${renderTabList(tabs, snippets)}

Each tab line may include a Summary with bracketed signals:
- [type: ...] — the page type (article, video, product, profile, website, book, music.song, etc.). This is the strongest signal for intent: 'article' tabs are reading, 'video' tabs are watching, 'product' tabs are shopping.
- [site: ...] — the site's brand name (e.g. "BBC News", "Vimeo").
- [topic: ...] — the page's main heading.

Guidelines:
- Use the signals above to infer what the user is DOING with each tab, not just what website they're on. Prefer category names that reflect that intent — "Reading", "Watching", "Research", "Shopping", "Work tools" — over narrow topic labels like "BBC", "Vimeo Videos".
- When multiple tabs share a [type:] or describe the same underlying activity, they belong in the same category even if their hostnames differ.
- Pick short, broad category names (1-3 words, Title Case).
- Aim for 4-10 stable intent buckets across a normal workspace. Broad but coherent buckets beat narrow one-tab categories.
- Keep adjacent intent families separate unless the tabs clearly share the same exact task: Docs (files, documents, writing) vs Research (articles, papers, reference reading) vs Work (trackers, admin, ops, business tools).
- Keep Shopping (products, carts, stores) separate from Finance (banking, payments, taxes, invoices) and Planning (calendar, maps, bookings, trips, events).
- Keep Communication (email, chat, messages, meetings) separate from Media (video, music, podcasts, streaming). Watching or listening is not the same as messaging.
- Keep Internal/Tools (browser settings, extensions, dashboards, dev/admin utilities) separate from user-facing content.
- Assign every normal web tab to a category. Single-tab categories are allowed when a tab has no clear sibling.
- Use "skipped" only for tabs that are empty, internal browser pages, unreadable placeholders, or otherwise impossible to classify.
- Do not echo a tab's title or hostname as a category name.
- Return raw JSON only. Do not use markdown fences, prose, comments, or explanations.

// ─── Merge (Phase 4b polish: consolidate over-specialized categories) ────────
//
// The schema is a flat key-value map (original → target) rather than nested
// arrays of objects. Small LLMs reliably emit this shape; nested arrays of
// {name, from:[]} consistently produced bad JSON in testing.

Rules:
- Tabs from the SAME provider belong together. For example, multiple google.com subdomains (calendar/drive/meet/docs/gmail/...) should all map to ONE category like "Google" or "Google Services". Same for any shared provider.
- Categories sharing a BROAD topic should map to the same target. Gaming-news, indie-games, streaming-services — all map to "Gaming". Multiple shopping-flavors — all map to "Shopping".
- Merge label variants that describe the same intent: Work / Work Management / Project Management; Planning / Planning & Tasks / Planning & Scheduling; Tools / Developer Tools / Admin & Tools / Admin & Settings.
- Aim for 4-10 stable intent buckets across a normal workspace. Broad but coherent buckets beat narrow one-tab categories.
- Keep adjacent intent families separate unless the tabs clearly share the same exact task: Docs (files, documents, writing) vs Research (articles, papers, reference reading) vs Work (trackers, admin, ops, business tools).
- Keep Shopping (products, carts, stores) separate from Finance (banking, payments, taxes, invoices) and Planning (calendar, maps, bookings, trips, events).
- Keep Communication (email, chat, messages, meetings) separate from Media (video, music, podcasts, streaming). Watching or listening is not the same as messaging.
- Keep Internal/Tools (browser settings, extensions, dashboards, dev/admin utilities) separate from user-facing content.
- A category that's genuinely standalone can map to itself.
